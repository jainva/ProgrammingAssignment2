## Below are two functions, 
##	first function can be used to cahe a matrix
##	second function utilize first function to check if it already contain inverse of the matrix, otherwise it calculate inverse and store in first function for future calculations

## Below function create a special matrix, which is actually list of functions to set/retrieve original matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function unitilize the first function to see if already contain inverse of first function. If the inverse is not available then it calcualte inverse and store in the 
## first function for future computations.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
